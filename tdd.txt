TEST-DRIVEN-DEVELOPMENT:
1. Unit tests prove that your code actually works.
2. You get a low-level regression-test suite.
3. You can improve the design without breaking it.
4. Test-first reduces the cost of bugs.
5. They demonstrate concrete progress.
6. Unit tests are a form of sample code.
7. Test-first forces you to plan before you code.
8. Unit tests make better design.
